In Assignment 3 I worked alone without a partner. I completeted all the 
necessary funtionality of the program. I have removed all of 
the references to TreeMap and implemented my own binary search tree.
This assignment was very intersting but also on of the more challenging
I learned a lot about this data structure and can see how it may be
 useful in my future programming endevours.
