The Java code in this directory corresponds to the appendix of
Computer Algorithms, Third Edition by Sara Baase and Allen Van Gelder.
Some List-related classes originate elsewhere in the text, and
the keyword ``public'' has been inserted before ``class''.
Also, imports have been made more specific, to import only what is used,
rather than ".*".
