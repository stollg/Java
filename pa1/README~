In this assignment we created a program which will read all lines 
from input text files using C's fgets Library Function
and prints out an adjacency list represenation of the
graph defined in the file. It will also accept input from the user via
stdin and return the corresponding adjacency list.

In order to properly run my program the following files must be in the
same working directory when the make command is called:

graph01.c
intList.c
intlist.h
Makefile

once it is confirmed that all these files or in the proper directory

type "make"(no quotes) into the command line.

that is all that is necessary to compile.

Now run the program by entering:

graph01 - (for standard input)
or
graph01 *.data (to read input from *.data file)
(Examples of test.data files are below.)
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Multiple testfiles are attached:

test1.data

INPUT:
3
1 4
1 5
2 3
3 5

OUTPUT:
bash-4.1$ graph01 test1.data
Opened test1.data for input.
n = 3
m = 4

1     [5][4]
2     [3]
3     [5]

This first test shows that if there are multiple adjacent vertices the 
program will recognize and print them along side eachother in the right
hand column.

test2.data

INPUT:
3
2 3
1 1
1 2

OUTPUT:
bash-4.1$ graph01 test2.data
Opened test2.data for input.
n = 3
m = 3

1     [2][1]
2     [3]
3     NULL

This second test shows that the program will print NULL if there are no 
vertices adjacent to the node.

test3.data

INPUT:
3
1 2
2 4
5 7
7 7

OUTPUT:
bash-4.1$ graph01 test3.data
Opened test3.data for input.
n = 3
Bad edge: 

this last test shows the the program will return a bad edge if the 
# of vertices exceeds the initialized amount.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


n = Number of vertices/nodes in the graph
m = Number of edges in the graph
Left: specifies the vertex
Right: lists adjacent vertices.
